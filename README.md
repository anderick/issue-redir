# Issue Redir

This project is a proof-of-concept to use GitHub features as a low-code tool.

## About

When you share a link in a social media platform, it tries to load for you meta information to better show your link. That's why instead of seeing:

You see something like:

<link here>

This project generates a link that redirects to any other link where you can redefine: 
- Title
- Description
- Image

This way, you can turn your links into more attractive and insteresting links, that you catch the attention of your audience.

    1. Line 3: image link (it can be a GIF)
